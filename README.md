## TUIT PROJECT

 ### Description
 Our group is interested in building the admin feature because we believe access control is an important part of a social networking website. Access control can be achieved when few users have rights to edit and delete while most users have view and create rights. Creating an admin tool helps us achieve different roles and responsibilities. It also provides the application the flexibility to make updates to the system without directly interacting with the database. This feature will ensure that posts and users are under surveillance and are restricted to post, comment on anything that hurts the community. It is a stand-alone feature from the existing system. This feature will help us build and understand the complete application system and connect the front-end, back-end, and database components. 

 ### Setting up the project on your local machine

 1) `git clone https://github.com/cesarguerrero1/team12-tuiter-frontend.git`
 2) Create a .env file containing the following variables 
    - ENV, that points to the respective local/production environments and
    - REACT_APP_API_BASE, that points to the base URL, 'http://localhost:4000' or the URL pointing to the hosted cloud application
 3) Run `npm install` to install all the required package dependencies on your machine (Refer to the Notes section for detailed dependencies!)
 4) Run `npm run build` followed by `npm run start` to pull up the application on your local port!
